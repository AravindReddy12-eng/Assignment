# Backend Developer Assignment — Machine Translation System

This repository contains my solution for the Junior Backend Developer assignment at EZ. The project demonstrates the design and implementation of a scalable, efficient, and cost-effective backend system for a machine translation service.

## Project Overview

The assignment includes:

- High-level system architecture design featuring GPU-enabled servers and container orchestration.
- Strategies for scalability, caching, and load balancing.
- Performance requirements to meet translation speed targets.
- API design with RESTful endpoints including authentication and rate limiting.
- Database schema design for job tracking and priority handling.
- Priority queue implementation to manage urgent translation requests.
- Monitoring and cost estimation approaches.
- Pseudocode implementation for task queue processing and autoscaling logic.
